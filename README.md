# RDR2DeathScreen

## How it works

This plugin adds the Red Dead Redemption 2 death screen a few seconds after the player dies and adds some post processing effects when the player dies. The plugin downloads a video and two audio files from this repo so the plugin can work. This will only happen one time when the plugin is ran for the first time or when there are missing files.
